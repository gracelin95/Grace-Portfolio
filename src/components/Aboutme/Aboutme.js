          <p> Hello there! I'm Grace. üëãüèº</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer and a recent graduate of Fullstack
            Academy's Grace Hopper Program. Prior to my transition, I worked in
            the insurance field as a Bodily Injury negotiator.

            {" "}
            I decided to transition into programming when I attended Fullstack's
            Demo Day and was absolutely amazed by how so many different projects
            can be created with just a laptop and a keyboard. And this is when I
            decided to start my journey. I'm excited to continue building more
            projects and continue learning all the endless knowledge there is
            out in the programming world.
